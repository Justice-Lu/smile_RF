## Feature Importances

This folder is used to identify and visualize the most important features in the Random Forest Model.

Analysis was performed on the most important features identified by the whole model and the most important features for sulfur-containing ligands respectively. 

See important_features.txt and sulfur_importance.txt for a ranking of feature importance based on Mean Impurity Decrease.

See Residue_Location.csv and Sulfur_Residue_Location.csv for the most important conserved location in all proteins. 

See the Images folder and the Sulfur_Images folder for visualizations of the important features highlighted in each protein as created with Pymol.
