# project-protein-fold
The repository contains three different machine learning models which predict olfactory protein - ligand binding without docking them first. The models included are a Random Forest Model, a Convolutional Neural Network, and a Graph Convolutional Neural Network.

## ProteinFoldRF
Creating a String-Based Random Forest Model Informed by Tertiary Structure of Proteins and Ligands to Predict Binding.

The model input includes amino acid sequence, protein tertiary structure (represented by 3Di sequence), and ligand sequence and structure (represented by SMILES string) and output is a classification prediction as to whether the protein and ligand will bind or not, informed by logFC and p-value.
